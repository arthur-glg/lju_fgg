- A lot of street of downtown tokyo were flooded in 50's and 60's 
- 8 rivers running through the city
- built a new resilience against natural disaters
- Quite challenging place for a megacity -> floodplain in a monsoon climate area with frequent typhoon, some part of the city are bellow sea level 
- The most rain for an Australian big city 
- The heat of the city is changing the rain pattern, the city is becoming subtropical even though it's a temperate area
- There is now heavy rainfalls dropping 100mm of water in an hour and their occurence arise by 50% from the last century 
- urbanization -> less ground to absorb water and no place to build new discharge channel 

**Solution :**
- Blue Sluice Gate (arakawa river) -> ocntrol unpredictable flood events divert water from eastern tokyo protecting 5,4 million people. 
- Kasukabe surge tank (largest in the world) , break the momentum of water and discharge the water to the Edo river. Connect 5 major water courses to the river, 6 km of tunnel (creating a new river). Powered by giants pump that allowed to discharged 200m3/sec. The system is built to manage a one in 200year event. The digged dirt is used to build levee that will no break event if there is a earthquake. Cost 3 billion to build but seems to have saved 1,1 billion of dammage since 2006
