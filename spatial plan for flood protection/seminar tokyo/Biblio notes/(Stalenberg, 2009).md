# The Battle of Tokyo and Dhaka Against Floods
Today, Tokyo is located at the mouth of three large rivers: the Sumida river (fi gure 5, no. 1), the Ara river (fi gure 5, no. 2) and the Edo river (fi gure 5, no. 3). The Sumida river fl ows through the centre of the metropolitis and is integrated into the urban patt ern of the city. The Edo river and the Ara river are located in the outer districts of the city; Many urban rivers contribute to the city’s drainage system against pluvial floods.

En 2009 on retient deux grandes mesures pour contenir ces innondations. 
- diversion channels and detention areas 
- using flood retaining structures such as "super levee" a multifunctional levee which combines spaces for transport, leisure and vegetation.
