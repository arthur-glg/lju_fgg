 # How Do Asian Religions Explain Natural Disasters?
Shintoism -> We should be aware that these kami usually have two faces in their nature, “harmonizing spirit (nikitama)” and “raging spirit (aratama).”

However, when they are in raging mode, they can cause disastrous situations such as droughts, floods, tsunamis, and so on. The problem here is that human beings can’t prevent the kami from becoming enraged — they try to appease or please the kami by conducting various types of ritualistic activities including festivals (_matsuri_) where sake and food is served to them

Therefore, kami represent almost everything, including the kami of disaster (_magatsuhi no kami_), the kami of earthquakes (_nai no kami_, represented as the catfish), and so on. Because of their nature, it is their job to cause disasters. There is no way we can stop them.
