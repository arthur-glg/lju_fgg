# Numerical simulation of urban impact on precipitation in Tokyo: How does urban temperature rise affect precipitation?
This study explored how heat island intensification affects precipitation in the Tokyo metropolitan area. It simulated two case (dense urban hypothesis and a less urbanizd one) for the data monitored between 2006 and 2013 for the summer season. 

The simulation results suggest that a mean temperature rise of less than 1 Â°C in Tokyo can lead to a statistically significant increase in August precipitation amount in the roughly 60 km square domain surrounding Tokyo. The increase reached 10% in the most urbanized (22 km square) domain. The thermal impact of urbanization in our simulation is likely an essential factor in the changes in precipitation in Tokyo.
