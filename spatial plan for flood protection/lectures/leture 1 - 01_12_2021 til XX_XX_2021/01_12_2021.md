## Presentation 

### Goals of the course 

- theoretical background of SP,
- practice of SP to manage the impact of floods on SP, 
- understand the urban rules (plot, owneship), vertical structure of the organization, 
- learn the methods through practical examples. 

### Seminar work 

It's an individual work. With a subjective point of view allowed (our opinion is asked)

Focus more on the practical experince. Showcase example and relate it to the article we collect in the bibliography.

## Introduction to spatial planning 

### General introduction 

> **Spatial planning** determines the framework of conditions for the  organization of space activities and the determination of a  sustainable and rational land use, taking into account and  coordinating various interests in space

Spatial planning is more stategic than urban planning (or called urban design) that is more oriented arround regulation and tools (a more detailed level)

> **Urban planning** sets out more detailed conditions and  regulations of building, development, reconstruction, etc., in an  urban area

### The importance of spatial planning 

Area are nor renewable, so problems rise about the function of the area (trafic congestions, extensive urban devellopement). 

There is a big distinction between the fact that these are local issues and the fact that few people living in these areas are involved in these issues. The goal of the spatial planning is also to emphase the identity of an area. 

The job of a spatial planner is to meet those requierment :

- environmental responsibility,  
- social equity,
- economic viability.

### Context of spatial planning 

Analysis of the area from different perspective (landscapes, nature, streets, buildings, materials, ...) to get an overview of the current situation. It's the first step before making plans. 

A timeline is also necessary to understand how it evolved during past time. 

The opinion and feeling of the population is a key analysis because spatial planning is above all a project for the inhabitants. Every stakeholders in the area are involved. 

<u>The priorities :</u>

- Strengthening the local community (equality, consultation and collaboration) 
- Creating places of distinction (access, amenity, safety) 
- Harnessing intrinsic site assets and resources (sustainability) 
- Integrating with surroundings (flexibility and innovation) 
- Ensuring feasibility (To ensure economic viability and deliverability, value management) 
- Providing vision (A vision focusses community aspirations)

### Social dynamics 

It's important to know the peolple and the activities in the area. To get those information we can develloped encounters with the locals such as workshop etc..

The first point is to detecting the problems of the area by making a diagnosis which synthesises all the perceptions of the stakeholders involved. 

Every places are differents and have their own identity and the spatial planner must not be jeopardised it. So we check :

- regional identity, 
- connection with the surroudings, 
- morphology, 
- natural elements, 
- socio-economic profile of the area. 

#### Involving users 

There is an inter-disciplinary (urbanist, biologist, architect) approach to the analysis. Are also involved : users, municipalities politician, investors, etc.

We are building public places. 

### Natural ressources

## Framework of spatial planning 

### Global context

More than half of global population is living in an urban area. Cities are quite taking over rural areas. In 1975, 11 cities had over 8 million inhabitants in 2000 there was 24 cities.

> **Climate change** : It is a change which is attributed directly or indirectly to human  activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and  which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over  comparative time periods

<u>The consequences of climate change in brief :</u>
*Spatial planning is eavly linked to the ecological problematics*,

- raise of the sea levels 
- heavy rainfall, hurricanes 
- extreme drought 

### Planning systems

<u>Plans about climate changes :</u>

- **1976 : Habitat 1 Conference**, politics is know recognized as change leaders and must take responsibility for managing the climate crisis 
- **1992 : Agenda 21 action plan**, dedicated a whole chapter to spatial planning. 
- **1999 : ESDP**, a document developed by european union. It's written that policy have to promote sustainable development. 
  Also :
  -  Spatial orientation of policies, 
  - Polycentric spatial development (decentralisation) and the new urban rural relationship, 
  - Equal access to infrastructure and knowledge, 
  - Responsible management of natural and cultural  heritage.

- **2002 : CEMAT**, more details about other stuff (tourism, natural disaters)
