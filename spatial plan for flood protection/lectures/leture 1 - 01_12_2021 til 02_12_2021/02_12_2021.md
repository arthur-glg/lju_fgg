### Planning systems (pt2)

#### An international planning framework

Some pinciples have to be takken in ocnsideration by all countries. It is somehow the role of the states that they can prepare on every level, the community do not have to do it by themselves. It's kind of a *written principle*. 
If there is no spatial plan → nobody can get buildings. 

> **Publicity :** Every spatial planning document is available 
>
> **Participation :** Getting people involved in the spatial planning decisions 

<u>Spatial famillies :</u>

Based on history. Strong communist bloc on the east. 

- Planning systems in the **British family** (a system of case law that  has gradually built up decision by decision) 
- planning systems in the **Napoleonic family** (has a tendency to  use abstract legal norms and enjoy greater theoretical  debate than the British style) 
- Planning systems in the **Germanic family** (a feature is the  importance given to the written Constitution - Basic Laws) 
- Planning systems in the **Scandinavian family** (The links  between the Scandinavian countries stem from the history of  conquests over the years by the Danish and Swedish Empires) 
- Planning systems in **eastern Europe** (after 1989 there are some  legal and administrative reforms)

### Planning system principles 

It's the way a society organize his deisions-making (legal & organization framework) and wich methods (methodology and practice) they are using. 

#### Legal framework 

- Set the coordination between Government, region, municipalities. 
- other stuff was boring 

#### Spatial devellopment policies  

<u>Slovenia case</u> 

|              |                   Strategy                   |                        Implementation                        |
| ------------ | :------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| **STATE**    | Policy<br />Strategy  of spatial development |                National spatial plan (1:1000)                |
| **REGIONAL** | Regional spatial plan<br />Scale is defined  |                   *No region in Slovenia*                    |
| **LOCAL**    |              Local spatial plan              | Local spatial plan  (1:5000)<br />Land use plan (most important)<br />Local detailed spatial plan |

#### What is a spatial plan :

- Graphical representation (maps, drawings), 
- Text which completes the maps 

### Policy debelopment to stratgic phase 

Depend widely of who are involved in the porcess. At the end it depend of decision makers (politicians).

1)  Set goals 
2) After start the creative phase (discuss everything possible, a phase of consultation between all)
3) Strategic phase (beggining phase so we need to know every stakeholders and also set the limits of the project)

<u>An exemple of a sequence :</u>

## Public participation and participatory planning 

Get everybody involved in order to get a wide range of opinion (do not forger children, elderly, homeless, immigrants...). 

<u>Why using participation :</u> Archiving a greater level of satisfaction for the planner as much as for the users. Take time at the beggining can help to be faster afterwards (beacaused we identified some possible problematics or things like this). 

<u>How to communicate with the public :</u> very important to tell something that can be understand by everyone (there is other way to communicate than maps).
